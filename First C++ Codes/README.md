# First C++ Codes (2018)

This folder contains some of my very first C++ codes, written in 2018 when I was just starting to learn programming.  
They include simple applications like a calculator, note system, password checker, factorial calculator, and a product system.

These codes represent my early learning phase, and they are important to me as a record of how I began with C++.

### Files in this folder:

- `calculator.cpp`: A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers based on user input.
- `notesystem.cpp`: A basic program for entering and storing grades.
- `password.cpp`: A simple password verification system.
- `powern.cpp`: A program that calculates the factorial of a number.
- `productsystem.cpp`: A basic product information display system using structures.

Feel free to explore how I started my C++ journey!
