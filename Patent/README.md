# Patent

This folder contains the patent application documents I prepared for two separate projects:

1️⃣ **Smart Watch**  
2️⃣ **Speed Charge System**

For each project, the following standard patent documents are included:

- **istemler.docx**: Claims (describing the scope of protection).
- **özet.docx**: Abstract (short summary).
- **tarifname.docx**: Specification (detailed explanation of the invention).
- **teknik-resimler.docx**: Technical drawings and visual representations.

These files are organized by project in separate folders.  
They are stored in `.docx` format for easier editing and revision.  
For official patent applications, these documents are usually converted to PDF or submitted via the relevant patent office's portal.
