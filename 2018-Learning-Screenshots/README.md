# Early Learning Screenshots (2018)

This folder contains some screenshots from my early days of coding with Arduino, when I was 13 years old.  
These images have no technical value today, but they hold personal meaning for me.  
They represent my first steps into the world of coding and electronics!

Feel free to browse and see how I started my journey.
