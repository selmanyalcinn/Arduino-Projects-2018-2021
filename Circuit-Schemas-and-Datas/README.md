# Circuit Schemas and Data (2018-2021)

This folder contains various materials related to my embedded systems and Arduino projects between 2018 and 2021.  
Here you’ll find:

- Circuit diagrams I created for different projects.
- Sensor data logs I recorded during experiments.
- Screenshots of code and working circuits.

These files helped me understand how sensors work, how circuits are connected, and how to document everything.  
Some of these are raw materials or drafts, but they’re a part of my learning journey!

### Contents
- **Schemas/**: Circuit diagrams and wiring plans.
- **Datas/**: Sensor data logs and collected measurements.
- **Screenshots/**: Screenshots of circuit simulations, code, or test results.

Feel free to browse and see how I explored electronics and sensors!
