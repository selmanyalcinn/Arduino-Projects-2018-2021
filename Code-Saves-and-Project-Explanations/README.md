# Code-Saves-and-Project-Explanations

This folder contains my mini-projects, an IoT-based smart smoking reduction project, and various code snippets I experimented with.  
Each mini-project has its own explanation and small code saves or drafts.

Feel free to explore and see how I learned and experimented with embedded systems and Arduino!
